# Poster-latex-template-HKU-PHYSICS-HKIQ
This is a template for latex code of academic poster of A0 size, with logos of HKU, physics and HK institute of quantum science and technology
This work is based on: University of Copenhagen Poster template with University of Copenhagen logo. Based on the a0poster class was created by Gerlinde Kettl and Matthias Weiser (tex@kettl.de)
I replace the color and logo in the previous version and created a HKU-HKIQ one
